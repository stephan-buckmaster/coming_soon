Purpose:

coming_soon is a simple template for a "coming soon" web page, that allows collecting email addresses for interested visitors / alpha testers.

Use it when you have registered a new domain name, and need a page to show, while you work on the site.

Requirements:

 * Apache
 * Ruby
 * sqlite3-ruby gem

Installation:

  1. Change HTML <title> tag and "div#content h1#title" according to your site name
  2. Place files on your web server / upload to hosting provider
  3. Customize as needed / change favicon.ico
  4. Remove README (this file)
  5. Optional: Configure script/backup_db.sh and install a crontab entry to backup the
     database every ten minutes if needed

Testing:

 1. Access front page.
 2. Fill in Email / Twitter text field and submit
 3. Check database update on server:

      sqlite3 db/notification_emails.sqlite3
      sqlite> select * from notifications;
  
 4. Check access to db is blocked:
    If your site is at http://mynewapp.com go to 

        http://mynewapp.com/db 
        http://mynewapp.com/db/notification_emails.sqlite3

    Should get an error page.
